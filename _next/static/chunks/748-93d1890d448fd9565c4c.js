I started my career at KPMG as an IT Engineer, then moved on to become a System Administrator at Novartis, the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. Following that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Realogy, the world\u2019s largest franchisor of residential real estate brokerages, where I developed LeadRouter, a web-based real-estate listing sales lead tool. At Realogy, I provided leadership as a subject matter expert on best practices and developed an intranet for technical documentation of development tools and APIs.
